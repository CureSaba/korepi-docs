# Korepi Community Code of Conduct

In the heart of Korepi lies a steadfast commitment to nurturing a community environment that is safe, welcoming, and inclusive for everyone. To uphold these values and ensure that all members have a positive and enriching experience, we have established a comprehensive Code of Conduct as follows:

## 1. Celebrating Diversity and Inclusivity

At Korepi, we deeply value and celebrate the rich tapestry of diversity that each member brings to our community. This includes, but is not limited to, differences in nationality, gender identity, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, age, abilities, and socio-economic backgrounds. We foster an atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding, recognizing that our collective diversity is our strength.

## 2. Zero Tolerance for Discrimination and Harassment

We maintain a strict zero-tolerance policy towards any form of discrimination, harassment, personal attacks, or derogatory conduct. Such behaviors, whether based on an individual's race, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion, nationality, cultural background, or physical or mental health status, are unequivocally unacceptable. Our community is a space for positive interactions and growth, not for causing harm or discomfort to others.

## 3. Upholding Privacy and Confidentiality

The privacy and confidentiality of our community members are of utmost importance. As such, it is strictly prohibited to disclose any personal information about others without their explicit consent. We advocate for respectful sharing of information within the community, ensuring that consent is always sought and given prior to any disclosure.

## 4. Commitment to Transparency and Integrity

Honesty, transparency, and integrity are cornerstones of our community. We expect all members to engage in communication that is truthful and transparent. Any form of deliberate misinformation, deceit, or unethical behavior undermines the trust and integrity of our community and will not be tolerated.

## 5. Adherence to Community Standards

We encourage all members to familiarize themselves with and adhere to our community standards. These guidelines are in place to foster a harmonious and respectful environment. Should any member witness or experience a breach of these standards, we urge them to report the incident promptly to community administrators or organizers for appropriate action.

## Commitment to Action

All members of the Korepi community are expected to embrace and uphold these principles. Any actions or behaviors contrary to the spirit of this Code of Conduct will be addressed promptly and appropriately. We are committed to ensuring that our community remains a space where respect is mutual, diversity is celebrated, and everyone feels valued and supported.

Together, by respecting one another and adhering to these guidelines, we can cultivate a community that is not only friendly and inclusive but also enriching and nurturing for all its members.
