## No Clip will allow you to have no collision, move faster and fly.
### No Animation:
- When enabled it will disable animations of the character while using no clip.
### Camera-relative movement:
- When enabled, character will move based on camera view instead of where the character is facing.
### Alternate No-Clip:
- When enabled, no clip speed will change after pressing the selected hotkey at the designed speed.
### Use Custom Keys:
- Enables the option to change no-clip directional controls.
### DragBack Bypass:
- Prevents the server to drag the character back due to excessive speed.

> Note: Not recommended to use above `20`.
