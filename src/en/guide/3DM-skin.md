## <span style='color:white;'>How to install custom Skins in `GIMI`</span>

### <span style='color:white;'>Step 1: Download the Skin</span>

Head to [Gamebanana](https://gamebanana.com/games/8552) and download a skin of your choice.

### <span style='color:white;'>Step 2: Install the Skin</span>

We will head to our `GIMI` folder and look for `Mods` folder, inside that folder we will extract the file we just downloaded.

### <span style='color:white;'>Step 3: Apply the skin</span>

If we are already inside the game we will use `F10` to reload the Skins, if not, we will open the game following the [last post](3DM-tutorial.md) and the skin should be applied.
