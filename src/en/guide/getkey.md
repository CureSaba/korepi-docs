- Follow the prompts
- If you are a Sponsor before February 4th, 2024, click `Sponsor Compensation` and enter `YES` to receive 3 months of compensation time.
- If you are not, please click `Bind Activation Code` and fill in the key obtained from various channels.
- Then click `Use Activation Code to Get Verification File`, and you need to fill in your `hwid (device ID)`.
- After that, put the obtained enc.json file in the same directory as your kp program, and it can run normally.
- You can also click `View Subscription Information` to view your subscription information.

## Pause Activation Code
- You can pause the activation code to prevent it from expiring.
- After the pause ends, your activation code will continue to count, and the paused time will be added.
- After pausing, you need to wait for 30 days before pausing again, and there is no limit on the pause time.

## Change Device ID
- After changing the device ID, you need to wait for 7 days to change it again.

## MD5 Verification Issue
- Each time you obtain the `enc.json` file again, the previous `enc.json` file will become invalid.
- If the latest one is still invalid, please obtain the file again. If it still doesn't work, wait for a while and try again.
