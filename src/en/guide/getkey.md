- Follow the flow of the prompt
- If you are a Sponsor prior to February 4, 2024, click on `Sponsor Compensation` and enter `YES` and you will be compensated for 3 months of your time!
- If you're not, click on 'Bind Card Key' and fill in the key you've obtained from various sources.
- Then click on 'Get authentication file with card key' and you will be asked to fill in your 'hwid(device id)`.
- Then put the enc.json file in the same directory as your kp program and it will work fine.
- You can also check your subscription information by clicking `View Subscription Information`.

## You can also view your subscription information by clicking `View Subscription Information`.
- You can suspend a key for a period of time to prevent it from expiring.
- After you end the pause, your key will continue to run and will add the time you paused it for.
- You can only pause it after 30 days. There is no limit to the amount of time you can pause it.

## Changing the device id
- You have to wait 7 days to change the device id.

## md5 checksum problem
- Every time you get the `enc.json` file again, the previous `enc.json` file will be invalidated.
- If your latest file is still invalid, please get a new one, and if it doesn't work, wait for a while and try again.
