### <span style='color:white;'>Method 1</span>

If your game folder contains non-original files, this prompt might appear for you. Check that theres only original files like the next example:

![](/assets/images/docs/202312/launcher.png)

![](/assets/images/docs/202312/folder1.png)

If you keep getting the error in-game even after deleting the files continue reading.

Go to your Korepi, go to `Settings --> Other`.

## What if nothing works?

You have to reinstall the game.
