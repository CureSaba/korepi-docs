## List of common issues

### Why my config doesn't save?

Keep in mind you have to extract the `.rar/.zip` file you got in another folder.

If config is still not saving after this step, please contact with any helper in the server for more help.

### Where do i find themes?

You can find themes for your Korepi on `community share` or you can make your own in Korepi settings.

Check `Theme Customization` to start making your own theme.
